# node-chat-app

Hello, My name is Tanmay Jha.

Here I have build a chat application using socket.io in node.js

You will find out the source file and public directory to learn how I use the concept of socket.io in my node.js chat application.
Clearly, you will find out the use of socket.emit, socket.io, socket.on, io.emit, io.on and much more things will we clear when you deploy the chat application on your local server
Go-ahead, and try this out and you will clear all your doubts free while learning with code and try to deploy your own application.

Thanks a lot
GoodBye!
